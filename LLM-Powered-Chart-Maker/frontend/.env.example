# Optional: set to your backend URL for local development (e.g. http://localhost:4000)
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000

# For Vercel deployments: leave VITE_API_BASE unset (the app will call the built-in /api serverless functions).
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY in the Vercel project Environment Variables to enable LLM calls from serverless functions.
